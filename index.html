					<h2><i class="fa fa-user-circle-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> About Me</h2>
					<p>My name is Nathan Vang and I am on a journey of learning IT, studying at Saint Paul College in St. Paul, Minnesota. As part of my work, this website will act as a portfolio of my projects, as well as containing my experiences in langauges and the such.</p>
					<p>Some hobbies I enjoy doing is going to the gym and reading. I usually go to the gym Monday, Wednesday, and Friday's. Each day transitioning between leg to upper body workouts with at minimum ten miniutes of cardio after each workout session. For reading, I enjoying reading fictional novels of various genres. One genre that I really like is LitRPG and the current novel that I am reading is called "The Path of Ascension."</p>
					<p>Fiction aside, I also am an avid reader of financial and self help books. One of my favorite financial books being "Rich Dad, Poor Dad" by Robert Kiyosaki and one of my favorite self help books being "How to win friends and Influence People" by Dale Carnegie. I want to say it's the best book that I've read that helped teach me how to interact with people. But not just interact but in some cases lead people.</p>
